Have you ever wanted to create your everyday Garry's Mod contraptions with just a few clicks? Now you can using the Action Recorder Tool!
The Action Recorder was a complicated tool to conceive (but extremely easy to use!), which allows you to record and playback any interaction in Garry's Mod and have full control over those interactions/movements, allowing you to effectively create otherwise complex contraptions or other shenanigans in just a pinch by "telling" your contraptions how to move instead of having to rely on constraint tools or other mechanical means of making a contraption work.


# Endless Posibilities! 

You can make anything with this: traps, parkour platforms, elevators, cannons, catapults, record yourself driving and replay it, and much more, the possibilities are endless!
There are also a whole bunch of features such as loop modes (loop, ping-pong, etc), playback modes (absolute, always plays recording at the place of recording no matter what, and relative, plays recordings and starts at where you moved it), as well as easing, which is a bit more complex and quite experimental, and it may not be perfect. Effects are toggleable for the client in the tool's properties panel.

# Out of the box support: 

Action Recorder also has support for many things out of the box, such as Wiremod, physgun freezing (if freeze on end is ticked), and also visual manipulations such as color tool, material tool, prop skins, and prop bodygroups.
# HOW TO USE TOOL: 

Left click with the tool to start going into recording mode, then interact with the props/entities you want to record, you can even record multiple entities in one go! When you are done manipulating the object, left click again to finish recording, and then right click to place a playback box that stores all the recorded data which can be played back. You will notice that playback boxes have their own ID, this is so the game can tell the difference between them. Playback boxes can be updated by putting their box id in the tool panel and then right clicking with tool
